# Environment settings file (.env)
#
# Keep configuration information out of code files
# and put it in a plain text file like this.
# Text makes it easy to manage key variables without modifying code.
# We can provide default values in the code in case this file cannot be read.
#
# Reading values in this file is easy. Just:
#
# 1. Install the external package dotenv into .venv
# 2. Import the load_dotenv function into your Python file
# 3. Call the load_dotenv() function (note the parentheses)
#
# For example: 
#
# from dotenv import load_dotenv
# load_dotenv()

# If Windows WSL, you may need to open powershell and run the wsl command

# Use that IP address in the ZOOKEEPER_ADDRESS below
ZOOKEEPER_ADDRESS=localhost:2181
